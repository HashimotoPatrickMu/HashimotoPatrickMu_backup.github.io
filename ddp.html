    <h2>How to use PyTorch DDP to train ONE model</h2>
    <p>PyTorch's Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) allows for efficient distributed training by dividing the data across multiple nodes and synchronizing the gradients. Here's a simple example using a single linear layer model.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Environment Setup</h3>
    <p>Before starting, ensure you have PyTorch installed and your environment is set up for distributed training. This typically involves setting up multiple GPUs on a single machine or across multiple machines.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Initialize the Process Group</h3>
    <p>DDP requires initializing the process group, which handles communication between the nodes.</p>
    <pre><code>import torch.distributed as dist

dist.init_process_group(backend="nccl", init_method="env://")</code></pre>

    <h3>Step 3: Create the Model</h3>
    <p>Define a simple linear model. When using DDP, each process (typically mapped to a GPU) will instantiate a copy of the model.</p>
    <pre><code>import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.parallel

class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 1)  # Example layer

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

model = SimpleModel().cuda()
model = torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel(model)</code></pre>

    <h3>Step 4: Train the Model</h3>
    <p>Train the model using your typical training loop, ensuring data is distributed appropriately across processes.</p>

    <h2>How to use PyTorch DDP to train TWO models</h2>
    <p>Training two models, such as in a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), involves handling two different models simultaneously. Here's a brief overview using DDP.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Define the Models</h3>
    <p>Define your generator and discriminator models. Similar to the single model case, each will be duplicated across processes.</p>
    <pre><code>class Generator(nn.Module):
    # Generator definition

class Discriminator(nn.Module):
    # Discriminator definition</code></pre>

    <h3>Step 2: Initialize DDP for Each Model</h3>
    <p>After defining the models, wrap each one with DistributedDataParallel.</p>
    <pre><code>generator = Generator().cuda()
discriminator = Discriminator().cuda()

generator = torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel(generator)
discriminator = torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel(discriminator)</code></pre>

    <h3>Step 3: Train the Models</h3>
    <p>During training, alternate between training the generator and discriminator. Ensure data is appropriately partitioned and synchronized across processes.</p>
    <pre><code>for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    # Train discriminator
    # Train generator</code></pre>

    <p>Remember to clean up and terminate the process group when your training is complete to free up resources.</p>
    <pre><code>dist.destroy_process_group()</code></pre>

    <p>This guide provides a basic understanding of using DDP with PyTorch. For more complex scenarios and best practices, refer to the official PyTorch documentation on distributed training.</p>
